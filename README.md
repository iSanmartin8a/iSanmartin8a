My name is **Alejandro Sanmartín**. I'm a *multiplatform and web* developer who is passionate about adapting to the different situations that are proposed. Some technologies I enjoy working with include **C#**, **Jamstack** (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and **MongoDB**. I am currently improving my <a href="https://isanmartin8a.github.io">portfolio</a> 😄 by taking advantage of the option given to us by Github Pages. In addition, I am developing a portal in which to locate the best quality WiFi networks by location 🖥️ and a mobile application 📱 with Flutter.

## Find me around the web:
